# Build e2e test artifacts using a host tools directory.
#
# This is copied and modified from build_tools/cmake/build_benchmarks.sh. We
# will remove build_tools/cmake/build_benchmarks.sh once everything has been
# migrated.
#
# The required IREE_HOST_BIN_DIR environment variable indicates the location
# of the precompiled IREE binaries.
#
# Designed for CI, but can be run locally. The desired build directory can be
# passed as the first argument. Otherwise, it uses the environment variable
# IREE_BUILD_E2E_TEST_ARTIFACTS_DIR, defaulting to "build-e2e-test-artifacts".
# It reuses the build directory if it already exists. Expects to be run from the
# root of the IREE repository.
