# Building IREE from source

While IREE does offer
[binary distributions](https://github.com/openxla/iree/releases) for its
compiler tools and [Python bindings](../bindings/python.md), building from
source is still useful when using IREE's runtime or when making changes to the
compiler or import tools themselves.
